# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.
Make Week# folder before pull request.
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed.
 And please optimize for readability, always use tabs.
Thanks,
Owner
